            First off, who are these people in this picture. Well theres me, obviously, my husband Bryan, and our two amazing kids! These 3 are my all time best friends, I love to spend most all of the time I can with them. 
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not with my fam that probably means I am out helping clients find their dream homes. I really enjoy doing Real Estate and plan on doing it forever. I enjoy the relationships I build with clients and love the strategy of negotiation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Being outdoors is something I love, hiking, swimming, snowboarding, I love it all. Which makes living in Salt Lake a great option for me, although the beach is at the top of my list, which we obviously don't have here in Utah.
          </p>

            As far as coding goes, I have taught myself here and there and let life get in the way of fully taking it on. I recently enrolled in Berkeley's coding bootcamp and have decided to move on with coding as a career. So far, its been a blast. Sure, it's challenging, but it's something I really enjoy doing. Graduation is just a few short months away, end of December. I am very excited to see where this journey takes me.
